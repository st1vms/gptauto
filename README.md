# gptauto

Chat GPT scraper

## What is this?

This Python software provides access to the conversational capabilities of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) through a simple chat messaging interface.

While not officially supported by OpenAI, this library can enable interesting conversational applications.

It allows for:

- Creating chat sessions with ChatGPT and getting chat IDs.
- Sending messages to specific chat ids, and even toggle chat history.
- Get an ordered, strong typed list of messages from any chat.

It relies on [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases), [selenium-wire](https://github.com/wkeeling/selenium-wire) and [selgym](https://github.com/st1vms/selgym) libraries to speed-up the completion waiting process, along some cool tricks for bot detection mitigations, such as random time intervals for character typing, button hovers and much more.

# Open new session on default firefox profile
scraper = GPTScraper()
try:
    scraper.start()

    # If Off -> On
    scraper.toggle_history()
finally:
    scraper.quit()
```

## Known bugs

- Sometimes a captcha may appear after sending a message,
so far this software does nothing to prevent this or act accordingly, if a captcha is triggered, the only current solution is to solve it manually, having non-headless behavior set by default.

- Currently this software does not work in headless mode, I don't know if I will ever be able to find a solution in the near future. Feel free to open a pull request if you found a on and would like to contribute, it will be much appreciated :)
